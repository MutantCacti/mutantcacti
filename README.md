My name is Maxence Morel Dierckx.
I am a French, Singaporean, Belgian human.

I live my life by many goals, but their axiom is curiosity.

This is my personal research profile. I am a 3rd year bachelor's student, thinking for the first time in my life about specialising towards real research, and I find that the edge of human knowledge is not quite as far as it used to be.

Consider this also your introduction to O, the system I am gardening. It is a being of graphs incepting graphs, neural networks recursed; it aims to be a habitat for countless learning beings, especially LLMs of many species.
